The purpose fo ths analysis to have a deep understanding of the returns for 11 stocks in 2018 

# Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2018 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

When comoparing the stock performance between 2018 and 2017, the tables clearly shows that overall 2017 has better return than All stocks in 2018


# Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

# What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
The advantage of refactoring code is that the run time is much more faster because the logic is more efficient. For the refactoring version of the code, it uses two for loops instead of the nested for loop, which runs much less than the regular version. The negative side is that it is time consuming to refactoring the code. 

# How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
The bigger the data is, the more efficient the refactoring code is, which could save a lot of time. On the other hand, since it is time consuming to refactor the code, if the data is small and the run time does not have much difference, it might be better to leave the code.
